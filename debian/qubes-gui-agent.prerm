# The prerm script may be called in the following ways:
#   * <prerm> 'remove'
#   * <old-prerm> 'upgrade' <new-version>
#   * <conflictor's-prerm> 'remove' 'in-favour' <package> <new-version>
#   * <deconfigured's-prerm> 'deconfigure' 'in-favour' <package-being-installed> 
#     <version> [removing conflicting-package version]
#
#     The package whose prerm is being called will be at least "Half-Installed".
# All package dependencies will at least be "Half-Installed" and will have 
# previously been configured and not removed. If there was no error, all 
# dependencies will at least be "Unpacked", but these actions may be called in 
# various error states where dependencies are only "Half-Installed" due to a 
# partial upgrade.
#
#   * <new-prerm> 'failed-upgrade' <old-version>
#
#     Called during error handling when prerm upgrade fails. The new package
# will not yet be unpacked, and all the same constraints as for preinst
# upgrade apply.
#
#    For details, see http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ or
